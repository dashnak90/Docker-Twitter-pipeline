# Data Pipeline with Docker
###### This project was completed in Week 6 of the Data Science bootcamp at SPICED Academy.
In this project, I built a ***Dockerized Data Pipeline*** that collect tweets that mention *'Python'* and stores them in ***Mongo database***. Next, the sentiment of tweets is analyzed and the annotated tweets are stored in ***Postgres database***. Finally, I built a ***Slack-Bot***, that publishes the latest tweet with sentiment score every 15 seconds.
